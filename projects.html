        <p class="description">In the spring of 2023, I took a Digital Production for New Media course where I was tasked with producing a short documentary film. Over the course of a semester, I worked with a partner in my class, Abbigail Ramnarine, to conceptualize, plan, film, and edit this documentary. The two of us completed this project on our own from start to finish, and we both edited our own versions of the documentary. My version of our documentary is titled <i>A Gateway Into Nature</i>. Check it out!</p>
        <p class="description">Our documentary spotlights the Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge in Queens, NY. I was shocked to find out that such a large national park exists in New York City. Through exploring the refuge and interviewing park rangers, I learned that the refuge is an integral part of the city. Our documentary discusses some of the negative effects of climate change and explains how the refuge is helping us fight it. We spent multiple days shooting b-roll footage at the refuge, capturing shots of the wildlife and the stunning views. We conducted several interviews for the film as well, three of which made it into my final cut. Thank you to Don Riepe, Zach Bailey, and Dr. Ilir Topalli for agreeing to be interviewed for this documentary. Thank you also to Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge and the National Park Service for letting us film at the refuge and setting up interviews.</p>
