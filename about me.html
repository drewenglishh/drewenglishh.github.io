        <h1 class="heading">About Me</h1>
        <p id="bio">I recently graduated from Fordham University’s Gabelli School of Business with a 3.8 GPA and a B.S. in Global Business with a concentration in Global Marketing with Consumer Insights.  I have had a wide array of experiences that have allowed me to apply my classroom business skills in the real world.  In the first half of 2023, I worked on a team as a consultant to Cloud Studio, an NYC-based marketing agency that serves clients such as Giorgio Armani and Bumble.  My team conducted two surveys to determine a strategic recommendation that would increase brand awareness and secure new clients for Cloud Studio.  Our proposal included an advertising campaign on Instagram and LinkedIn and SEO improvements to Cloud Studio’s website.  We presented our proposal to Cloud Studio’s Founder and CEO in a 45-page Canva presentation as part of a consulting competition where we achieved first place.  This past March, I started an internship at Emily Renee & Co, a fast-paced start-up aimed at providing digital marketing services to small businesses.  My primary responsibilities include developing social media strategies tailored to each client's unique needs, creating Instagram, TikTok, and Pinterest content for clients and the company, and analyzing social media metrics to inform and drive strategy.  These experiences have helped me develop my abilities to manage time well and pay attention to detail, as well as improve my written and verbal communication skills.  Feel free to explore my website and check out some of the projects I have worked on while at Fordham.  You can contact me at aenglish6@fordham.edu.  I look forward to hearing from you!</p>
